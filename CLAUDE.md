### Environment-Specific Commands
- **Dev Server (Development)**: `yarn start:dev`
- **Dev Server (Staging)**: `yarn start:staging`
- **Dev Server (Production)**: `yarn start:prod`
- **Build (Development)**: `yarn build:dev`
- **Build (Staging)**: `yarn build:staging`
- **Build (Production)**: `yarn build:prod`

### Deployment Commands
#### Development Environment

## Code Style Guidelines
- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code with proper type definitions
- **Imports**: Group imports by external packages, then project imports
- **Component Structure**: React functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch blocks and propagate errors with context
- **Formatting**: 2 space indentation, 80-column width
- **AWS SAM**: Used for infrastructure deployment via template.yaml
- **Comments**: JSDoc format for functions, minimal inline comments

## Project History
