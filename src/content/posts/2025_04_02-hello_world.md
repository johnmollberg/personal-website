# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog where I'll be sharing thoughts on technology, web development, and other topics I'm passionate about.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I plan to cover:

- Web development with React and TypeScript
- Cloud infrastructure on AWS
- Performance optimization techniques
- Personal projects and lessons learned

## Code Examples

Here's a simple React component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface GreetingProps {
  name: string;
}

export const Greeting: React.FC<GreetingProps> = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};
```

## Stay Connected

I'll be posting regularly about topics I find interesting. Feel free to reach out to me on social media with your thoughts or suggestions for future posts.

Thanks for reading!
