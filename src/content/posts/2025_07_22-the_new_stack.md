# The New Stack: How AI Tools Are Reshaping Software Engineering—and Its Hiring Funnel

Over the past year, the role of a software engineer dramatically changed. Tools like ChatGPT and Claude Code aren't just novelties anymore - they're legitimate extensions of developer productivity. What used to take me a full day can now often be accomplished in an hour, with two or three AI sessions running in parallel. And while this is a thrilling acceleration for those of us already embedded in the craft, it also raises a serious question for the future of engineering teams:

**Why would a company hire a junior software engineer when a senior one, empowered with these tools, can move ten times faster?**

This isn't a rhetorical question. It's a hiring strategy dilemma—and one I think more engineering leaders and recruiters need to start grappling with.

## The Vanishing On-Ramp: What Happens to Junior Engineers?

The traditional model for growing an engineering team relied on layering in experience. You'd hire junior engineers to take on simpler tasks, freeing up senior engineers for more complex architectural or cross-functional work. Over time, those juniors would grow, absorb mentorship, and become seniors themselves.

But with the advent of highly capable AI coding assistants, this pyramid is cracking. A senior engineer today can:

- Scaffold an entire service with Claude in 15 minutes.
- Generate integration tests and CI config in the background during meetings.
- Spin up documentation, type annotations, and database schema changes with near-zero overhead.

In short: a well-armed mid/senior engineer is not just faster — they can do *everything* a junior could, and more. That makes it hard to justify hiring junior engineers purely for “capacity.” If that's all you need, you'll get better ROI from a senior paired with Claude.

That said, the long-term consequences of this optimization may be dangerous. If we stop hiring and mentoring juniors today, we risk starving the talent pool of tomorrow. The best teams will find a way to balance this—continuing to train while rethinking the work we assign.

## The New Job Description for a Senior Engineer

In my current role, I find myself less focused on typing code and more focused on orchestrating the entire software creation process — with AI tools now acting as key collaborators. I am often running a few claude code sessions at once. Usually, I have one or two going for feature work and bug fixes, and one for helping me handle day to day inquiries that come in, such as analyzing logs for error patterns or generating scripts for one time data clean-up tasks. Much of my actual focus is on reviewing AI output with a critical eye in case my tools go down the wrong track or start generating output that isn't based on solid software principles.

The job has changed. It's no longer just about solving problems—it's about *framing* them in ways these tools can understand, accelerating solutions without sacrificing quality. In this new world, fluency in prompt engineering is becoming as valuable as fluency in any specific language or framework. This isn't hype — it's now a core professional skill.

## Beyond Chat: The Rise of MCP Servers

One important shift in how we build software today is the increasing ubiquity of **MCP servers** — Model-Context Protocol servers that expose business logic and developer workflows to LLMs in a structured, accessible way.

There are thousands of these already. Some are for popular tools like GitHub, Jira, or Figma, and some are custom designed for AI agent interaction. If a tool can serve JSON, it can be made LLM-compatible—and increasingly, it is.

In my work, these integrations have gone far beyond coding assistants. I’ve used MCP-connected tools to:

- Let Claude update core GitHub branches, generate release notes, and even publish builds to production.  
- Parse and implement designs from Figma with fully styled, production-ready components.  
- Connect to ClickUp to interpret acceptance criteria, log work, and update ticket statuses.  
- Automate real browser behavior with Puppeteer, triggered entirely via AI-generated instructions.

These tools are becoming the standard interface layer between humans, LLMs, and systems. Once in place, you unlock an environment where an AI agent can reason about your workflows and participate in them directly.

It’s no longer about AI as a “copilot.” It’s about giving AI the ability to *drive* — within constraints you define.

## What This Means for Hiring, Team Design, and the Future

We're entering a new era of software development—one where small, senior-heavy teams can outperform larger traditional orgs. That's a shift every hiring manager and engineering leader needs to be thinking about right now.

### Implications include:

- **Hiring strategies will shift** toward fewer but more experienced engineers, who can command AI effectively.
- **Mentorship models must evolve**, or we'll face a talent drought in 5–10 years.
- **Team productivity should be remeasured**, because individual throughput is no longer a fair metric when each person is enhanced by multiple AI assistants.

We're not replacing engineers — we're multiplying them. And the best ones I know aren't threatened by AI. They're already using it as an extension of themselves.

## Final Thought

The companies that win in this new landscape will be the ones that:

- Empower their best engineers with the right AI tools and infrastructure.
- Redesign their team models to reflect the real productivity curve.
- Invest in future talent, even when it doesn't look immediately efficient.

If I were building a team from scratch today, I wouldn't just hire great engineers—I'd build an environment where those engineers can work *with* AI in real time, supported by internal APIs, good documentation, and well-structured MCP surfaces.

This isn't the future of work. It's already here.
