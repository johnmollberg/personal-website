Dear Stripe Billing Team,

I'm applying for the Staff Engineer, Usage Based Billing role. I've spent the last five years building billing systems — and the last year deeply on Stripe's platform — architecting subscription management, webhook processing, and payment failure monitoring for Arccos Golf's 100K+ subscriber base. I want to bring that merchant-side perspective to the team building the platform itself.

**Why this role fits:**

Over five years I've led our customer base through price increases, implemented multiple subscriptions per account and designed a negative billing system to support a hardware trial that generated hundreds of thousands in revenue. Under the hood, I built an event-driven backend with EventBridge, SNS/SQS, and Lambda to process Stripe webhooks reliably, and set up CloudWatch alarms for payment failure monitoring. I've navigated the real-world complexity of Stripe's APIs — recurring billing edge cases, subscription lifecycle management — and I know exactly where merchants need more from the platform.

The job description mentions embedding with high-growth companies to translate their needs into product features. I've been that customer. I've felt the friction points, worked around the limitations, and shipped revenue-critical systems on top of Stripe Billing. That firsthand experience is hard to replicate.

**What I bring beyond billing:**

Beyond billing, I built CI/CD pipelines, an A/B testing framework, internationalization, and OAuth integrations — all while managing a cross-platform team of 4+ engineers, hiring 2, and promoting 1 to senior. I also serve as a primary technical advisor across product, finance, and operations — scoping initiative feasibility and shaping what gets built. I drove engineering standards adopted across the organization: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, monitoring and alerting systems, and release processes. I'm comfortable operating at the intersection of deep technical work and cross-team leadership, which is exactly what a staff role on a team scaling from pilot to GA demands.

**On the technical requirements:**

I have 10 years of experience across distributed systems, event-driven architectures, and high-throughput data processing. My backend work spans Node.js, TypeScript, Python, and Kotlin, with deep AWS infrastructure experience (Lambda, EventBridge, SNS/SQS, CloudFormation). Beyond the billing systems I built, my company's core product runs on an event-driven backend that processes tens of thousands of events per second at peak season, and earlier in my career I built Kafka pipelines consuming CDC events, transforming them through stream processors, and materializing them into application-specific data stores.

I'm based in the Minneapolis metro area and would be working remotely. I'm excited about the opportunity to help take Usage-Based Billing to General Availability — especially given how central it is to the AI company growth wave Stripe is positioned to capture.
